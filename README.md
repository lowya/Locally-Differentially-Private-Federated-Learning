# Locally-Differentially-Private-Federated-Learning
Code for the paper "Locally Differentially Private Federated Learning: Efficient Algorithms with Tight Risk Bounds," by Andrew Lowy &amp; Meisam Razaviyayn. The paper can be found at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09779

Our code requires Python 3 to run. 
Dependencies: math, numpy, matplotlib, torchvision, sklearn, pandas, scipy, itertools 

The comments in the scripts explain where to change the user parameters (K, R, N, epsilon, â€¦). Once those are set, simply run the script (making sure you are in the proper directory) to reproduce the plots from the paper.
