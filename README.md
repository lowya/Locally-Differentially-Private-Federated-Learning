# Locally-Differentially-Private-Federated-Learning
Code for the paper "Private Federated Learning Without a Trusted Server: Optimal Algorithms for Convex Losses," by Andrew Lowy &amp; Meisam Razaviyayn. The paper can be found at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09779

Our code requires Python 3 to run. 
Dependencies: math, numpy, matplotlib, torchvision, sklearn, pandas, scipy, itertools, pickle

The comments in the scripts explain where to change the user parameters (R, N, Mavail, epsilons, etc.). Once those are set, simply run the script (making sure you are in the proper directory) to reproduce the plots from the paper.
